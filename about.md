Hello traveler. Thanks for stopping by. My name is Stefan Pate. I am interested in biology, machine learning, biking to work, soccer, basketball, tapas, pizza, and a few more things. I'm currently working on my PhD under the mentorship of [Keith Tyo](https://tyolab.northwestern.edu/) and [Linda Broadbelt](https://broadbelt.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University in sunny Evanston, Illinois, USA. I've focused on computational methods to design enzymatically-catalyzed syntheses of target products. On this website you can check out some of the projects I've worked on in lab and some stuff I did at home. Enjoy!
